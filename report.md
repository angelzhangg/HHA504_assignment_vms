## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to provide hands-on experience with managing Virtual Machines (VMs) in both Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You will learn how to start, stop, and monitor the costs associated with running VMs on these cloud platforms.

### 1. Start and Stop a Virtual Machine
- **Azure:**
  - Navigate to the Azure portal and create a new Virtual Machine.
  - Choose a basic configuration (e.g., Ubuntu Server, Standard B1s size).
  - Start the VM and allow it to run for a few minutes.
 
### 2. Monitor VM Costs
- **Azure:**
  - After starting and stopping the VM, navigate to the Cost Management and Billing section.
  - Find the cost associated with running your VM for the time it was active.
- **GCP:**
  - In the GCP Console, go to the Billing section and identify the cost incurred by your VM during its runtime.
    
### 3. Compare and Reflect
- Compare the costs of running a VM in Azure versus GCP. Consider factors such as the configuration used, the duration for which the VM was active, and any differences in cost visibility between the platforms.
- Reflect on the ease of starting, stopping, and monitoring VMs on each platform. Which platform did you find more intuitive or user-friendly? Why?
